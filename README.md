# Advent of Code 2023

These are my [@fbartho](https://github.com/fbartho) quick & dirty puzzle solutions for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) puzzles

These are not optimized in any way, and just reflect a solution I got to with minimal effort.

This year I solved the problems in Swift.
